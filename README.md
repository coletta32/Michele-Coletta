-  ✋🏽Hello my name is Michele Coletta.

- 🍀 I always try to be authentic, easy going and like to help people when I can. 

- 🎾 I grew up playing tennis since I was 3 years old, long journey of discipline, travel, happiness, frustrations, winning, lossing but it helped me be where I am today. I played college tennis and by 2019 I stopped playing competitive tennis. I made eternal friendships and had important coaches that taught me strong values.

- 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦 Family is essential for my existence, I enjoy and learn from them as much as I can. 

- 📖 My interests are in sports and production management. I would like to jump into these fields for my future careers.

- ☑️ My goal after I accomplish my MS in Business Analytics is to have all the major skills on Tableau and SQL. 

- 🌞🌚 Finally I enjoy any adventures with nature either by sea or by snowy mountains. A quiet time for yourself surrounded by nature can help you reach inner peace. 

- 🗣 I speak English, Spanish, Italian and fluent in Portuguese.
